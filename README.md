# printf Project

printf
: is the C language function to do formatted printing.

## Project Description

This projects needs to be completed by a team. The purpose of the project is to replicate the printf function.

Project Learnings:

* Applying variadic functions.
* The printf functions and complexities
* Team work
* Github contribution.

Tasks:

0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life.
    * Write a function that produces output according to a format.
    * You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
        * c
        * s
        * %

Prototype
```
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
```

1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't.
    * Handle the following conversion specifiers:
        * d
        * i

2. Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the gospel
    * Create a man page for your function.

### Compilation
Your code will be compiled this way
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c
```
